class FeatureDescriptor(FrozenClass):
    """A FeatureDescriptor object, containing all feature information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    function : Union[FuncWrapper, Callable]
        The function that calculates this feature.
        The prototype of the function should match: \n

            function(*series: np.ndarray)
                -> Union[Any, List[Any]]

    series_name : Union[str, Tuple[str, ...]]
        The names of the series on which the feature function should be applied.
        This argument should match the `function` its input; \n
        * If `series_name` is a string (or tuple of a single string), than 
            `function` should require just one series as input.
        * If `series_name` is a tuple of strings, than `function` should
            require `len(tuple)` series as input **and in exactly the same order**
    window : Union[float, str, pd.Timedelta]
        The window size, this argument supports multiple types: \n
        * If the type is an `float`, it represents the series its window size in
            **seconds**.
        * If the window's type is a `pd.Timedelta`, the window size represents
            the window-time.
        * If a `str`, it represents a window-time-string. \n
            .. Note::
                When no time-unit is present in the string, it represents the stride
                size in **seconds**.

    stride : Union[int, str, pd.Timedelta]
        The stride of the window rolling process, supports multiple types: \n
        * If the type is `float`, it represents the stride size in **seconds**
        * If the type is `pd.Timedelta`, it represents the stride-roll timedelta.
        * If a type is `str`, it represents a stride-roll-time-string. \n
            .. Note::
                When no time-unit is present in the string, it represents the stride
                size in **seconds**.

    Notes
    -----
    * For each `function` - `input`(-series) - `window` - stride combination, one needs
      to create a distinct `FeatureDescriptor`. Hence it is more convenient to
      create a `MultipleFeatureDescriptors` when `function` - `window` - `stride`
      _combinations_ should be applied on various input-series (combinations).
    * When `function` takes multiple series (i.e., arguments) as input, these are
      joined (based on the index) before applying the function. If the indexes of
      these series are not exactly the same, it might occur that not all series have
      exactly the same length! Hence,  make sure that the `function` can deal with
      this!
    * For more information about the str-based time args, look into:
      [pandas time delta](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timedeltas.html#parsing){:target="_blank"}
    <br><br>
    .. todo::
        * Add documentation of how the index/slicing takes place / which
          assumptions we make.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        Raised when the `function` is not an instance of Callable or FuncWrapper.
